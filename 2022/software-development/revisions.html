<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This slide deck tries to give a brief summary of the most important topics covered in my part
of the course. However, keep in mind that it's not possible to condense all lecture material
into one slide deck, so some things may be missing!</p>
<p>There are more theoretical and more practical lectures. For the theoretical ones, you should have
understanding of the key concepts, but you don't need huge amount of detail. For practical ones,
you should be able to apply them to sample problem or code.</p>
</section>

<h1>Module structure (1/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Principles</strong>  (<a href="history.html">history</a>, <a href="oss.html">open-source</a>, <a href="principles.html">principles</a>, <a href="sdi.html">environment</a>)</p>
<p><em>These lectures cover theoretical material (with the exception of "contributing to open-source"
section). You should understand the key principles from the lectures.</em></p>
<p><em>These lectures do not follow a textbook, so your best resources are the lectures. Those are based on various books
and papers, but often pick only a couple of ideas from a long book.</em></p>

<h1>Module structure (2/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> (<a href="quality.html">quality</a>,<a href="structure.html">structure</a>,<a href="errors.html">errors</a>,<a href="architectures.html">architecture</a>)</p>
<p><em>These lectures cover important practical engineering practices.
This includes code quality (indentation, naming,
error handling) and architectural patterns. You should be able to write code that follows
such patterns or find issues in code that does not follow them.</em></p>
<p><em>There are good online resources for some of the topics, but the lectures do not directly follow
one resource, so it's best to follow lectures and occasionally look elsewhere.</em></p>

<h1>Module structure (3/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Processes</strong> (<a href="agile.html">agile</a>, <a href="testing.html">testing</a>, <a href="theory.html">theory</a>)</p>
<p><em>These lectures are about managerial aspects of software engineering. This includes
eXtreme programming and Scrum that you should be familiar with as well as testing
(and the related Test Driven Development method). For testing, we also covered theory on how
to design tests well, which you should also be familiar with.</em></p>
<p><em>You can find many more information about all those topics online and elsewhere, but you are
not required to know more than what was presented in the lectures.</em></p>

<h1><strong>Engineering</strong></h1>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Code quality (1/2)</h1>
<p><strong>What is good quality code</strong></p>
<p><em>We talked about naming, comments, whitespace and code structure (the idea of keeping
the "happy path" simple). You should be able to point out quality issues in a code snippet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Keeping good quality</strong></p>
<p><em>How to keep good quality? There are social methods (pair programming, code reviews) and
tools (linters).</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Code quality (1/2)</h1>
<p><strong>Refactoring for quality</strong></p>
<p><em>An important concept is refactoring - code modification that improves quality without changing
what code does. You should know where refactoring fits in test-driven development.</em></p>
<p><em>We talked about two concrete examples in lectures and classes and you should know about these:
"rename" (changing the name of a variable or a function) and "extract function" (move code
into a new function).</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Living with errors</h1>
<p><strong>Different application domains</strong></p>
<p><em>We talked about approaches to errors differ for different application domains
(business computing, telecommunications, computer art).</em></p>
<p><strong>Good practices</strong></p>
<p><em>We looked at specific practices. Why exceptions are better than returning error codes?
What are the three ways of handling bad inputs (ignore, recover, fail immediately)
and which might be better when?</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Large software architectures</h1>
<p><strong>Architectural design patterns</strong></p>
<p><em>We talked about several architectural patterns: Layered architecture
(and three-tier), service-oriented (and microservices), pipeline, blackboard, event-sourcing</em></p>
<p><em>You should know when they may be appropriate, what are the benefits they promise
and what are possible drawbacks of choosing them.</em></p>

<h1><strong>Requirements</strong> - Ticket machine software</h1>
<p>The user of the machine should be able print previously purchased tickets or purchase tickets.
When purchasing tickets, they should be able to choose origin and destination, select a date and
time for travel, select a railcard and pay for the tickets, either using card or cash.</p>
<p><em>1) Write a user story for a regular passenger</em><br />
<em>2) Write a user story for a student with railcard</em></p>

<h1><strong>Equivalence class partitioning</strong> - Ticket prices (1/2)</h1>
<p>Students with student card get 25% discount on any fare. Those with network
railcard get 20% discount, but only on off-peak trains (after 10am or weekends).</p>
<p><em>1) What are the equivalence classes for <code>computeDiscount</code>?</em>
<em>2) Give best test inputs using boundary value analysis</em></p>

<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Origins and history (1/2)</h1>
<p><strong>Why is building software hard?</strong></p>
<p><em>In what ways are "software systems" different than "algorithms"
and why is this making them hard to build?</em></p>
<p><em>You can have a quick look at the <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf">No Silver Bullet</a>
essay, which was mentioned in the lecture, but the summary in the lecture is sufficient.</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Origins and history (2/2)</h1>
<p><strong>Software industry crises</strong></p>
<p><em>The lecture discussed three "crises" that were caused by some developments in the industry
(typically societal changes leading to the need to build different kinds of system). Those are
1950s Labour crisis, 1970s Software engineering response and 1990s Application crisis.</em></p>
<p><em>You should know what caused these crises and what tools or methods were response to those.</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Open source software (1/3)</h1>
<p><strong>History and issues</strong></p>
<p><em>The lecture compared the culture of "commercial software" and "free software" and discussed
some of the issues in open-source community such as sustainability and code of conducts.</em></p>
<p><em>You should know that these issues exist and give one or two ways in which the principles behind
commercial and free software differ.</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Open source software (2/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Different licensing models</strong></p>
<p><em>We compared a number of licensing models, namely the free software model (free as in freedom),
dual licensing model (pay with either money or code), consulting and corporate models (free as
in free beer).</em></p>
<p><em>You do not need to know any license details, but you should be able to say the differences
between GPL and MIT/BSD/Apache. You should also know how different models are typically funded.</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Open source software (3/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Contributing to open source</strong></p>
<p><em>This is a more practical part of the lecture. We talked about how to contribute to open-source
software, looking at consistent coding style and minimal, complete, verifiable examples for
reporting issue. You should also be able to write code in consistent coding style.</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Software engineering principles (1/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Complexity of software systems</strong></p>
<p><em>We looked at the key points made by Fred Brooks - you should know what the terms "accidental"
and "essential" complexity mean.</em></p>
<p><em>We also looked at reasons for why building software is hard. You should recall the problem with
"non-repeated digital systems" and classification of programs (S, P, E-programs).</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Software engineering principles (2/3)</h1>
<p><strong>Environment of software systems</strong></p>
<p><em>We discussed why are some systems (such as anti-ballistic-missile defence systems) hard to build
and discussed characteristics of the environment that make building software hard.</em></p>
<p><em>You should remember the conditions under which a system can be "mastered"
(what kind of systems in what kinds of environments).</em></p>
</section>
<section >
<h1><strong>Key things</strong> - Software engineering principles (3/2)</h1>
<p><strong>Three key principles of software engineering</strong></p>
<p><em>You should remember the three key principles discussed in the lecture:</em></p>
<p><em>First, why is building "programming systems product" 10x harder than "program".
Second, why we cannot expect order of magnitude improvement in productivity and,
third, why adding manpower to a delayed project makes it later.</em></p>
